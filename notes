### Step6 - Biological replicate reproducibility and differential expression analysis
Differential expression analysis and principal component analysis were performed with the package DESeq2 v1.40.2 (Love et al., 2014) for the R statistical suite **(RCoreTeam, 2024). All charts were plotted with the R package ggplot2 v3.5.1 (Wickham, 2016). The volcano plots in Figure 5 were drawn with the R package EnhancedVolcano v1.18.0 (Blighe et al., 2024).

### Step7
Read normalization across the genome
Normalized read density over non-overlapping 50-bp bins was calculated using the normalization reads per genomic content (RPGC) in the utility bamCoverage from the bioinformatics suite deeptools2 v3.5.4 (Ramirez et al., 2016).

### Step8
Meta-gene profiles of RNA-Seq signal were generated with deeptools2 computeMatrix and plotted with plotProfile.

### Step10  - TPM and intron/exons - **work in progress
TPM (transcripts per million) were calculated as in **Wagner et al, 2012.
For each sample, we divided the number of reads aligned on the exons of each gene by the length of the gene, to obtain the "reads per kilobase" (RPK) of each gene. We then divided the sum of all RPKs by 1,000,000, to have a sample-specific "scaling factor" that accounts for the library size. Finally, we divided the RPKs values by the scaling factor to obtain the TPM of each gene.

### Step11
Replication timing analysis
Maize B73 replication timing (Repli-seq) data including G1 and early, mid and late S-phase datasets from sorted nuclei in the mitotic cell cycle of terminal 1-mm root tips (NCBI SRA # PRJNA327875; Wear et al., 2017) were analyzed using the Repliscan application (Zynda et al., 2017; Mickelson-Young et al., 2022)** implemented on the CyVerse Discovery Environment platform (Swetnam et al., 2024). The recommended maize B73 parameters from Mickelson-Young et al. (2024)** were used, except that the full datasets (not downsampled) were mapped to Zm-B73-NAM-5.0 genome assembly (Hufford et al., 2021), and the following minor modifications were made. Read densities were aggregated in 10-kb non-overlapping windows across the genome (--window 10000). Each 10-kb window was assigned a predominant replication time (RT) class using a segmentation threshold of 1.0 (--threshold value, --value 1.0), so that the segmentation algorithm included any window with early, mid or late replication signals that are greater than the G1 reference signal (> ratio of 1.0).
